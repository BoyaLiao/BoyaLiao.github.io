## Boya Liao (廖博雅)
I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Technology at the Department of Computer Science and Technology, [ZheJiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). I’m honored to work under the guidance of Prof. [Mingli Song](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/msong) at the [Laboratory of Visual Intelligence and Pattern Analysis](https://www.vipazoo.cn/). 

Before joining ZheJiang University, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Technology from [Chang'an University](https://en.chd.edu.cn/).

I am deeply interested in computer vision, data visualization.
