I am Bo-Ya Liao, currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Technology at the College of Computer Science and Technology, [ZheJiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). I’m honored to work under the guidance of Prof. [Mingli Song](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/msong) at the [Laboratory of Visual Intelligence and Pattern Analysis](https://www.vipazoo.cn/). Before joining ZheJiang University, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Technology from NorthWest University

I am deeply interested in computer vision, multimodal learning and explainable AI, with a particular focus on leveraging AI to solve real-world problems in fields like healthcare, finance, and construction. Additionally, I am dedicated to exploring ways to enable robots to perceive and truly understand the world, endowing robots with real eyes.

I enjoy hiking, playing badminton, and swimming. Exercising helps me stay more focused and improves my work efficiency :)
