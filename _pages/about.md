Welcome to my homepage!😊 I’m Boya Liao. I am currently a research intern at Westlake University, where I am supervised by Prof. [Huang Wang](https://huanwang.tech/). Prior to this, I completed my M.Eng. in Computer Technology, where I was supervised by Prof. [Mingli Song](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/msong) at the [VIPA](https://www.vipazoo.cn/). I earned my B.Eng. in Computer Science and Technology from Chang’an University.

I am deeply interested in computer vision, MLLMs and Efficient AI, with a particular focus on leveraging AI to solve real-world problems in fields like healthcare, finance, and construction. Additionally, I am dedicated to exploring ways to enable robots to perceive and truly understand the world, endowing robots with real eyes.

I enjoy hiking, playing badminton, and swimming. Exercising helps me stay more focused and improves my work efficiency :)
